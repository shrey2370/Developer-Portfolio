                <p>
                    Practera is a project-based experiential learning platform, designed by teachers and instructional designers to

                    brings students, teachers, and industry mentors together to achieve their project outcomes. I was successful in 
                    applying for this project-based work experience through the university. In groups, we were allocated projects 
                    that we had to complete within a three-week timeframe, and then present to the client. These projects were 
                    based on social media marketing.
